# ClassroomQuest Gamified Curriculum Implementation Plan (Pre-K to Grade 6)

## Introduction

This document maps the Pre-K to Grade 6 curriculum topics and gamified learning strategies to a concrete iOS/iPadOS app design for **ClassroomQuest**. It describes how each subject area and grade level can be addressed with age-appropriate game mechanics and how to implement these in Swift/SwiftUI using only on-device content generation, Core Data for local storage, no external backend (offline-first), and integration with Apple frameworks like SwiftUI, StoreKit 2, GameKit, and AVFoundation. The design incorporates progression systems (levels, streaks, rewards), adaptive difficulty via a local mastery model, and parent engagement features (progress dashboards, iCloud syncing of progress, etc.). All suggestions are grounded in research findings and tailored per age group to ensure age-specific gamification that is technically feasible in an offline SwiftUI app.

## Platform Foundations

| Area | Implementation Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Generation** | Use local JSON or Core Data entities for question banks, dynamically templated prompts, and procedural variations. Leverage CreateML-on-device models or simple rule-based systems for adaptive difficulty. |
| **Persistence** | Core Data with lightweight migrations stores learner profiles, mastery scores, streaks, rewards, and parent dashboard snapshots. Use CloudKit-backed persistent stores for optional iCloud sync. |
| **Progression Layer** | A `ProgressionManager` singleton tracks XP, level thresholds, daily streaks, and badge unlocks. Integrate with GameKit achievements where COPPA-compliant (ages 13+ require parental permission; below this use only local badges). |
| **Adaptive Difficulty** | For each subject, maintain `MasteryRecord` (per topic) with `successCount`, `errorCount`, and `lastDifficulty`. Adjust future question difficulty using an Elo-style update or logistic function. |
| **Rewards & Economy** | Offer soft currency (stars) and cosmetic unlocks (avatars, classroom décor). StoreKit 2 can enable parent-purchased expansion packs while core curriculum remains free. |
| **Accessibility** | Use Dynamic Type, VoiceOver labels, `AVSpeechSynthesizer` narration, haptics, and color contrast compliance. Provide parent controls for sound, narration, and reward pacing. |
| **Parent Engagement** | A separate parent tab (FaceID/TouchID gated) displays dashboards, printable/SharePlay study plans, and allows manual activity assignments. |

## Progression and Reward Systems

1. **XP & Levels:** Every completed activity grants XP scaled by difficulty and streak. Levels unlock new quest zones and cosmetic items. Implement using Core Data `LearnerProfile` with `xp`, `level`, and `unlockedItems`. Level thresholds computed locally.
2. **Daily/Weekly Streaks:** Use `AppStorage` or Core Data to store `lastLoginDate` and compute streak continuity. Provide calendar heatmap (Swift Charts) for visual reinforcement. Offer “rest day” tokens earned via parent approval to maintain healthy balance.
3. **Badges & Achievements:** Local badges visible in trophy room (`LazyVGrid`). For older grades, sync optional achievements to GameKit with parental controls.
4. **Quests & Storylines:** Each grade features an overarching narrative (e.g., explorers, guardians, innovators). Quests have prerequisites and branching outcomes stored in Core Data. `NavigationStack` drives story progression; `@StateMachine` pattern manages quest states.
5. **In-App Economy:** Soft currency (stars) awarded for mastery; spend on avatar customization, class décor. StoreKit 2 enables purchasing additional theme packs. All transactions respect parental controls and StoreKit Ask-to-Buy.
6. **Feedback & Reflection:** After each activity, present a reflection card summarizing mastery score, hints, and next steps. Implement via bottom sheet (`presentationDetent`). Encourage journaling with optional prompts saved to parent dashboard.

## Adaptive Difficulty & Mastery Modeling

- **Mastery Records:** For every topic, maintain `MasteryRecord` with rolling accuracy and latency. Use logistic update to adjust difficulty, storing `proficiencyLevel` (Emerging, Developing, Proficient, Mastery).
- **Item Selection:** Generate next activity by weighting topics with lowest mastery. Use local randomization to avoid repetition. Provide “Challenge Mode” for high mastery to sustain engagement.
- **Hint System:** Offer tiered hints unlocked after incorrect attempts. Hints cost soft currency to promote thoughtful use. All hint text stored locally.
- **Review Cycles:** Schedule spaced repetition prompts using `UNUserNotificationCenter` (with parental consent). Display review queue in parent dashboard.

---

## Parent & Teacher Engagement

- **Parent Dashboard:** Gate with biometric auth. Show learner progress charts, streaks, mastery heatmap, and recent work gallery (drawings, writing samples). Provide export to PDF (`PDFKit`).
- **Assignments:** Parents can assign quests by selecting topics and difficulty. Core Data stores custom playlists; scheduler uses local notifications to remind the child.
- **Insights:** Provide AI-lite insight cards (rule-based) that analyze mistakes and suggest offline activities. No cloud processing; use heuristics on stored data.
- **iCloud Sync:** Offer toggle to sync profiles via CloudKit. Use NSPersistentCloudKitContainer for seamless offline-first operation.

---

## Safety, Privacy, and Compliance

- **COPPA & Privacy:** No external analytics. All data stored locally or via iCloud with parental consent. Provide clear privacy settings and data export/delete options.
- **Child Profiles:** Support multiple learners with avatar selection. Profiles isolated; cross-profile viewing requires parent auth.
- **Content Moderation:** All content curated locally. For user-generated text (writing prompts), restrict sharing externally unless parent approved.
- **Offline-First Design:** All assets packaged with the app or generated locally. Provide optional download packs via StoreKit to extend content while remaining offline usable.

---

## Technical Architecture Overview

- **Modular Structure:**
  - `Core` module: shared models, services (`ProgressionManager`, `MasteryEngine`).
  - `Features` modules per subject/grade with `FeatureFlag` toggles.
  - `UI` module using SwiftUI scenes; embed SpriteKit/SceneKit where needed.
- **App Flow:**
  1. Launch screen leads to profile selection.
  2. Home hub displays quests, streaks, featured missions.
  3. Selecting a quest pushes into subject-specific game view.
  4. Completion returns to summary sheet, updates progression, and unlocks rewards.
- **Testing Strategy:**
  - Unit tests using XCTest for mastery logic and progression.
  - UI tests for critical flows (profile creation, quest completion).
  - Snapshot tests (if available) for consistent visuals.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate `SharePlay` study sessions for collaborative problem solving when network is available.
- Explore on-device generative storytelling (e.g., using Apple’s Core ML) for dynamic narratives.
- Add ARKit modules for grades 4–6 to explore 3D models of scientific concepts.
- Provide teacher portal (separate app or parent-mode extension) for small group management.

This plan ensures ClassroomQuest remains engaging, developmentally appropriate, and technically feasible within the offline-first SwiftUI architecture, while providing rich gamified experiences across all elementary grade levels.
