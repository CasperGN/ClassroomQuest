# 2nd Grade Curriculum (Age 7–8)

Second graders broaden their skills (introducing multiplication concepts, more complex reading, etc.) and can engage in more sophisticated game elements. They start to enjoy friendly competition and teamwork in gamified contexts. We continue the use of progress tracking and collectible rewards, adding features like a simple in-app economy where coins earned can be spent on cosmetic items. Group challenges or comparison with peers (safely, e.g., siblings or a class) can be motivating.

| Subject & Topic | Gamified Strategy | SwiftUI Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Math**: Addition/subtraction fluency within 100; Intro to multiplication (2s, 5s, 10s times tables); Simple division (concept of sharing); Basic fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4 of shapes); Measurements (ruler, units); Time to quarter-hour; Money (making change). | **Adventure with currency and collaboration**: Create a “Math Market” where learners solve problems to earn coins, then spend them on items to build something (ingredients to cook or parts to build a simple machine). Introduce an in-app economy and choice in spending. Include occasional group challenges—if multiple profiles or a classroom mode exist, show a collective goal (e.g., “All players solve 50 problems total to unlock a party animation”). For math facts, incorporate a friendly race (timed quiz where they try to beat their own or a friend’s score). Keep emphasis on personal improvement and fun themes (like a carnival or market). | - **Math Market**: Create a series of tasks as “orders” to fill—e.g., a character asks for 8 apples, and the child must solve 4 + 4 to fulfill it. Each correct solution gives coins. Maintain a coin balance in Core Data. Use StoreKit 2 only if allowing actual purchases; in-app currency here is earned, not bought (except perhaps an option for parents to unlock more cosmetic items in a separate shop). Implement a `ShopView` in SwiftUI showing items (images) that can be “bought” with coins to decorate an area or avatar. Handle the purchase by deducting coin balance and unlocking the item (persist in Core Data).
| | | - **Collaboration Challenge**: If offline and multiple users share the iPad, track a “group goal” by summing progress of all local profiles. Use Core Data to accumulate a shared count (or allow a teacher to combine data manually). If online (future), GameKit could allow a closed group goal. Show a Group Progress Bar (like a communal goal meter) in the UI when a challenge is active.
| | | - **Timed Race**: Reuse the timed quiz from Grade 1 but allow input of another player’s best score as a target. If GameKit is enabled with Game Center, use a leaderboard to fetch a “friends’ average score” for a particular quiz. In SwiftUI, present the timer quiz and at the end show a local leaderboard (an ordered list of local profiles or Game Center friends). If offline only, encourage beating personal best: store high score in Core Data and show it as the score to beat.
| | | - **Fractions & Shapes**: Use interactive visuals—e.g., a circle or square that can be “cut” into halves/thirds by tapping (implement by overlaying shape segments). Gamify by making it a pizza or pie that they share. This is a visual puzzle: SwiftUI can show portions of a shape (perhaps with `Trim` on a `Circle` shape) and animate filling pieces when they answer fraction questions.
| **Language**: Reading longer stories (paragraph length); Vocabulary building; Basic grammar (plural, tenses); Writing simple sentences. | **Quest & creation**: Launch a “Vocabulary Quest” where each new word learned is a monster caught or a treasure found. Introduce a pet sidekick that grows as the child reads more (virtual pet responding to reading streaks). Incorporate a creative writing mini-game with story prompts or half-finished comic strips for the child to complete. Gamify grammar with a sentence-building game (reordering words to make a sentence, with funny incorrect options to keep it light). | - **Vocabulary Quest**: Maintain a list of target vocabulary words. Each word has a small challenge (definition quiz or using it in a sentence via multiple choice). Represent each word as a “monster” or collectible card. Implement a collection view for caught monsters/treasures. On learning a word, the monster is “captured”—show an animation (monster jumping into a book). Store word data locally and track progress as words learned out of total.
| | | - **Virtual Pet for Reading**: Provide a tamagotchi-like view with an animal or creature that levels up or changes as the child reads daily. Each day they read a story, the pet gains a happiness point or grows. Use Core Data to log daily reading; use `Date()` to check streaks. Animate changes (pet grows or gains features) at milestones.
| | | - **Sentence Builder**: Offer jumbled words as draggable chips and an empty sentence line to drop them in order. SwiftUI can list words and allow dragging into an `HStack`. If the order is correct, animate the sentence (e.g., flash border green) and optionally use `AVSpeechSynthesizer` to read it aloud. If incorrect, shake the sentence using a small offset animation and let them try again. Include humorous wrong combinations to encourage experimentation.
| | | - **Creative Writing**: Offer prompts or partially blank comic strips (images with speech bubbles). Let the child fill in text fields or choose words to complete the story. Save these creations (text or snapshots) in Core Data for later review by parents or the child.
| **Science**: Introduction to scientific method (observe, simple hypothesis); Earth & space basics (planets, moon phases); Life cycles (e.g., butterfly); Simple physics (magnetism, gravity basics). | **Experiment simulations and discovery**: Build a virtual science lab where kids conduct simple experiments—mix harmless “chemicals” to see outcomes, with embedded quiz questions (“What do you think will happen if…?”). Launch a space adventure game: travel through the solar system by answering questions about each planet. Create a life-cycle puzzle: arrange images in order (egg → caterpillar → butterfly) as a game. Wrap learning in narrative (“Complete the butterfly’s life cycle to help it fly!”) and reward with science badges or telescope items for the avatar. | - **Virtual Lab**: For a magnetism mini-game, show a magnet and various objects. Let the child drag objects toward the magnet; if it’s magnetic, animate it sticking (using state and `withAnimation`). If not, it falls. Then explain why via text or audio. This interactive simulation uses on-device physics approximations (SpriteKit optional).
| | | - **Space Adventure**: Use a horizontal scroll or paging view to represent planets. Each planet’s view contains a question or fact. Optionally include ARKit for 3D viewing, but a 2D map with a rocket icon moving between planets suffices. Animate the rocket along a path with sound effects to enhance immersion.
| | | - **Sequencing Puzzle**: Display cards or images representing life-cycle stages that the child must reorder. Implement drag-to-sort within an `HStack`/`VStack` by updating an array’s order. Provide feedback on correctness and reward success with an animation of the life cycle.
| | | - **Rewards**: Award thematic items—e.g., completing space adventure unlocks a virtual “telescope” or a “Space Explorer” badge. Handle item unlocking in Core Data similar to avatar items.
| **Social Studies**: Basic geography (map of country, key landmarks); Cultural traditions; Religion: Important figures/stories, moral lessons. | **Exploration and challenge games**: Develop a “World Explorer” map game where children tap regions to answer questions or learn facts. Add a time-travel adventure to meet historical figures and answer questions to progress. For religion, introduce a quiz tournament on key teachings (styled like a friendly Jeopardy game). Emphasize collaboration with a family quiz night mode. | - **World Explorer Map**: Use a map image with clickable hotspots (`Button` views positioned via `GeometryReader`). Tapping a spot reveals a fact or question via an alert or custom callout. Facts are pre-stored to work offline.
| | | - **Time-Travel Story**: Present a sequence of story scenes via `NavigationStack` or a custom state machine. Meeting a historical figure triggers a question whose correct answer advances the timeline.
| | | - **Quiz Tournament**: Build a multi-round quiz UI with a simulated NPC opponent. Track scores and display a victory screen after the rounds. Support turn-based family play by alternating active profiles and recording individual scores.
| | | - **Family/Group Mode**: Allow multiple profiles to play in turns, comparing scores at the end. Store separate scores for each participant during the session.
| | | - **Rewards**: Grant badges for geography mastery (“History Buff”) or cultural exploration, plus unlockable avatar accessories (e.g., historical hats or cultural costumes).

This curriculum integrates narrative-driven gamification, social motivation, and SwiftUI-first implementation details tailored to second graders.
